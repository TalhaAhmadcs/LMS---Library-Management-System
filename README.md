- ### **Borrowing:**
When a patron wants to borrow a book from library, he/she will take the book to librarian (LMS User). LMS allows Users to register book borrowings via multiple means to facilitate users
- Registering Borrows Directly, where user will have to manually input both Book ISBN & member ID
- User can search a book in catalog, select borrow, and just enter member ID to Register the Borrow
- User can search & select patron from records, and then register a borrowing against him by putting rest of details. <br>
Note:- System Ensures Book is registered and available in library, also books can only be borrowed by a registered & active patron, system won't let user proceed otherwise <br>
